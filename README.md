### Hello, I'm Kevin Javier Zvonarek 👋
- I’m currently studying **Physics**, **Mathematics**, and **Computer Science** at the University of Michigan. 
- I will be developing starter SWE projects in the coming months so stay tuned!
- I'm interested in reading, speed-cubing, and working-out.
- Feel free to check-out a website I made from the hugo-academic [tutorial](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/get-started/). I will be taking it down soon and making my own from scratch!
