### Hello ðŸ‘‹
- Iâ€™m currently studying **Physics**, **Mathematics**, and **Computer Science** at the University of Michigan.
- I'm interested in educational outreach and related interventions.
- Outside of sandboxing with code, I enjoy live entertainment and art of all kinds, practicing chess/speed-cubing, and reading.
