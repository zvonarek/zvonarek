### Hello ðŸ‘‹
- I'm wrapping up my study of **Physics** and **Mathematics** at the University of Michigan in May 2023.
- Outside of sandboxing with code, I enjoy writing and live performances (music, theatre, etc.).
- I'm interested in educational outreach and related interventions, ethics x tech., and complex systems.
